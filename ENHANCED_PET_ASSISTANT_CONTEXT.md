## üéØ Problem Solved
The Pet Assistant now has access to comprehensive information about your active pet, including:
- **Feeding schedules and food preferences**
- **Exercise and activity history**
- **Weight tracking and trends**
- **Health records and medications**

This eliminates the need for users to repeatedly provide pet information and enables highly personalized AI responses.

## üöÄ What's New

### **Comprehensive Pet Data Integration**
The Pet Assistant now automatically loads and includes:

#### **üçΩÔ∏è Feeding Information:**
- Current food items with nutritional details
- Today's feeding schedule with completion status
- Upcoming planned meals
- Food preferences and dietary restrictions
- Calorie tracking and portion information

#### **üèÉ Exercise & Activity Data:**
- Recent exercise sessions with duration and intensity
- Activity types and patterns
- Calories burned during activities
- Exercise notes and observations

#### **‚öñÔ∏è Weight Management:**
- Recent weight records with dates
- Weight trends over time (gaining/losing)
- Weight change calculations with time spans
- Nutritional context for weight management

#### **üè• Health & Medical Data:**
- Current medications with dosages
- Recent health records and diagnoses
- Medical conditions and allergies
- Breed-specific health considerations

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Enhanced Data Loading**
```typescript
// Get feeding information
const allFoodItems = await unifiedDatabaseManager.foodItems.getAll();
const foodItems = allFoodItems.filter((item: any) => item.petId === activePetId);
const recentMeals = await unifiedDatabaseManager.meals.getByPetIdAndDate(activePetId, new Date());
const upcomingMeals = await unifiedDatabaseManager.meals.getUpcoming(activePetId, 5);

// Get exercise/activity information
const recentActivities = await unifiedDatabaseManager.activitySessions.getRecentByPetId(activePetId, 10);

// Get weight records for nutrition context
const recentWeightRecords = await unifiedDatabaseManager.weightRecords.getRecentByPetId(activePetId, 5);
```

### **Comprehensive Context Generation**
The AI now receives detailed context about your pet:

```
IMPORTANT PET INFORMATION - USE THIS DATA FOR PERSONALIZED ADVICE:

```

## üéØ AI Response Examples

### **Before Enhancement:**
```
User: "What should I feed my dog for dinner?"

AI: "I'd be happy to help with feeding recommendations! Could you tell me about your dog's breed, age, weight, and any current food preferences or dietary restrictions?"
```

### **After Enhancement:**
```
User: "What should I feed my dog for dinner?"

AI: "For Buddy's dinner tonight at 6:00 PM, I recommend following your planned 500-calorie meal. Given that he's a 3-year-old Golden Retriever weighing 65 lb with a slight weight gain trend (0.5 lb over the past week), here's my specific advice:

Dinner Recommendation for Buddy:
‚Ä¢ Combine his Royal Canin dry food with Blue Buffalo wet food as planned
‚Ä¢ Portion: 1 cup of dry food (340 cal) + 1/2 can of wet food (160 cal) = 500 total calories
‚Ä¢ Since he's gaining weight slightly, consider reducing portions by 10% to help maintain optimal weight
‚Ä¢ Given his hip dysplasia, ensure he gets joint-supporting nutrients - the Royal Canin formula is good for this

Based on his recent exercise (30-minute walk burning 120 calories), this calorie amount is appropriate. Since he loves the Royal Canin and likes the Blue Buffalo, this combination will keep him satisfied while supporting his joint health needs."
```
