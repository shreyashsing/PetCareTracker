/**
 * Firebase Cloud Messaging Test Script
 * 
 * This script demonstrates how to test the FCM implementation
 * by sending test notifications through Firebase Console.
 * 
 * Steps to test Firebase Console messaging:
 * 
 * 1. Run your app on a physical device
 * 2. Check the logs for your FCM token (will be logged as "[FCM] Firebase token: YOUR_TOKEN")
 * 3. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
 * 4. Navigate to your project
 * 5. Go to Messaging section in the left sidebar
 * 6. Click "Send your first message"
 * 7. Fill in the notification details:
 *    - Title: Test Title
 *    - Body: Test Message
 * 8. In the "Target" section, select "Single device"
 * 9. Paste your FCM token
 * 10. Review and publish the message
 * 
 * Notification Behavior:
 * - If app is in foreground: The notification will be displayed manually by your app
 * - If app is in background: The notification will appear in the system tray
 * - If app is closed: The notification will appear in the system tray
 * 
 * Additional data payloads:
 * You can also send custom data payloads from Firebase Console:
 * - Go to "Advanced options" when creating a message
 * - Add custom key-value pairs in the "Custom data" section
 * - Example: type = medication_reminder, petId = pet123

/**
 * How to Test FCM Locally:
 * 
 * 1. Make sure you have @react-native-firebase/app and @react-native-firebase/messaging installed
 * 2. Check your firebase.json configuration is correct
 * 3. Run the app on a physical device (not simulator)
 * 4. Initialize the app and observe the FCM token in logs
 * 5. Send a test message from Firebase Console
 * 6. Observe the notification behavior in different app states

/**
 * Common Issues:
 * 
 * 1. Missing google-services.json or GoogleService-Info.plist
 *    - Make sure these files are in the correct location
 *    - Android: android/app/google-services.json
 *    - iOS: ios/GoogleService-Info.plist
 * 
 * 2. Foreground notifications not showing
 *    - This is expected behavior, FCM doesn't automatically show notifications when app is in foreground
 *    - You need to manually display them using expo-notifications (implemented in fcm.ts)
 * 
 * 3. Notifications not working in development builds
 *    - Make sure you're testing on a physical device
 *    - Verify Firebase project configuration
 *    - Check that you have the correct FCM token
